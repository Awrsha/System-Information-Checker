Sure! Here's an advanced `README.md` file for the Advanced System Information Checker project implemented in Python:

# Advanced System Information Checker (Python)

This project is an advanced system information checker implemented in Python. It provides detailed information about the system, CPU, memory, disk, and network. It utilizes the `psutil` library to gather system information and `platform`, `datetime`, `cpuinfo`, `socket`, and `uuid` modules for additional system details.

## Introduction

The Advanced System Information Checker project retrieves comprehensive information about the system, including system details, boot time, CPU information, memory information, disk information, and network information. It provides valuable insights into the system's performance and resource utilization.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- psutil: A cross-platform library for retrieving system information. It can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awrsha/System-Information-Checker.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

## Usage

To run the Advanced System Information Checker, follow these steps:

1. Open the Python script file (`system_information_checker.py`) in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

1. Run the Python script.

1. The script will gather and display detailed system information, including:

   - System information: name, node, release, version, machine, and processor details.
   - Boot time: the date and time when the system was last booted.
   - CPU information: physical and total core count, CPU frequencies (max, min, and current), CPU usage per core, and total CPU usage.
   - Memory information: total memory, available memory, used memory, and memory percentage.
   - Swap information (if available): total swap memory, free swap memory, used swap memory, and swap memory percentage.
   - Disk information: partitions and their usage details, including total size, used space, free space, and percentage usage. Additionally, it displays the total read and write bytes.
   - Network information: network interfaces, IP addresses, netmasks, broadcast IPs, MAC addresses, and broadcast MACs. It also shows the total bytes sent and received.

1. The system information will be displayed in the console.

Feel free to modify the script or incorporate it into your own projects to gather system information programmatically.
